# Deproj

A simple tool to deproject direct imaging observations of debris disks.

In principle it could work for any kind of disks that you are interested in, but since the disk is assumed to be vertically flat, it is most likley more accurate for debris disks rather than prot-planetary disks.

Work in progress, more later on

## To be done

- [ ] Install script
- [ ] Additional parameters for the plotting, `vmin`, `vmax`, `xlim`, etc
- [ ] Plotting options, only polar, only cartesian, full, etc
- [ ] Provide either a file name, or provide a 2D frame directly
- [ ] Automatic determination of the inclination and position angles? Would increase the dependencies required.
